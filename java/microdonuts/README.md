# MicroDonuts: An OpenTracing + OpenTelemetry Shim with Lighstep Launcher

Welcome to MicroDonuts! This is a sample application instrumented with OpenTracing.
It uses OpenTelemetry Shim with Lighstep Launcher.

## Step 0: Setup MicroDonuts

### Getting it
Build the jar file (for this, Maven must be installed):

```
mvn package

communicate each other over HTTP - they are, however, part of
the same process:

```
mvn package exec:exec
```
