## PR checklist for examples

Check these items before merging the PR.

- [] Each example contains a README file.
- [] README documents all steps and variables required to run the example. The simplest way to confirm this is to follow the instructions on a clean machine.
- [] README file contains the links to the official documentation with relevant configuration and to the metrics published if that is available.
- [] Used images of apps and collectors have to be pinned, "latest" should never be used.
- [] Evidences with screenshots provided from the reviewer.
- [] Includes a file called `metrics.csv` with metrics produced by the example.
    The file should have these 5 headings: Name, Description, Unit, DataType, Attributes.
    Description is not provided for all metrics, so it may be blank. Attributes are also not always provided. When there are multiple attributes on a metric reord they should be space separated.
