# Lightstep OpenTelemetry Examples

This repository contains example code and resources for configuring a variety of languages with OpenTelemetry. The directory structure for each language looks like this:

```
go
├── launcher - these applications are using the opentelemetry launcher, a config layer built
               on top of opentelemetry
├── opentelemetry - these applications are configured and instrumented using opentelemetry
                    directly
└── opentracing - these applications are using the OpenTracing bridge available in
                  OpenTelemetry. The code is instrumented using OpenTracing.
```

### Running examples

All the applications in this repository can be launched using docker-compose. In order to send data to Lightstep, you can update the configuration using the steps below before starting docker-compose:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightstep/opentelemetry-examples && cd opentelemetry-examples

# copy the example environment variable file
# and update the access token
cp ./config/example.env .env
sed -i '' 's/<ACCESS TOKEN>/YOUR TOKEN HERE/' .env
# if using the AWS OpenTelemetry Distro, use `example-aws-collector-config.yaml`
cp ./config/example-collector-config.yaml ./config/collector-config.yaml
sed -i '' 's/<ACCESS TOKEN>/YOUR TOKEN HERE/' ./config/collector-config.yaml

docker-compose up
```

The following client/server applications use different mechanism for sending data to Lightstep. The following examples are configured in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

| name             | description                                                  |
