# Ingest metrics using the IIS integration

The OTel Collector has a variety of [third party receivers](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/receiver) that provide integration with a wide variety of metric sources.

Please note that not all metrics receivers available for the OpenTelemetry Collector have been tested by Cloud Observability Observability, and there may be bugs or unexpected issues in using these contributed receivers with Cloud Observability Observability metrics. File any issues with the appropriate OpenTelemetry community.

## Prerequisites

You must have a Cloud Observability Observability [access token](/docs/create-and-manage-access-tokens) for the project to report metrics to.

## Running the Example

You can run this example with `docker-compose up` in this directory. This will work for Windows machines used as host. Otherwise you will be required to launch virtual Windows environment and switch docker context.

## Configuration

Installation of the OpenTelemetry Collector varies, please refer to the [collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) for more information.

IIS by default exposes metrics to log files, that's why the integration requires a use of [Windows Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter).

IIS metrics described [here](https://github.com/prometheus-community/windows_exporter/blob/master/docs/collector.iis.md#metrics).

The example collector's configuration, used for this project shows using processors to add metrics with Cloud Observability Observability:

``` yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: otel-iis
          static_configs:
            - targets: [iis:9182]

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  otlp/public:
    endpoint: ingest.lightstep.com:443
    headers:
        "lightstep-access-token": "${LS_ACCESS_TOKEN}"

processors:
  batch:

service:
  pipelines:
    metrics/iis:
      receivers: [prometheus]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [logging, otlp/public]
```
