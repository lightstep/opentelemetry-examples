# Ingest Clickhouse metrics using the OpenTelemetry Collector

## Overview

 Clickhouse natively exposes a Prometheus endpoint and the OpenTelemetry Collector has a [Prometheus receiver][otel-prom-receiver] that can be used to scrape its Prometheus endpoint. This directory contains an example showing how to configure Clickhouse and the Collector to send metrics to Lightstep Observability.

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* A Lightstep Observability [access token][ls-docs-access-token]

## How to run the example

* Export your Lightstep access token
  ```
  export LS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
  ```
* Run the docker compose example
  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
* Run clickhouse client
  ```
  docker run -it --rm --network prom-native-clickhouse_default --link clickhouse-server:clickhouse-server yandex/clickhouse-client --host clickhouse-server
  ```
  * Create DB
  ```
  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS tutorial;
  ```
  * Create table
  ```
  CREATE TABLE tutorial.xyz (a UInt8, d Date) ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY (a) PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(d);
  ```
  * Insert record data
  ```
  INSERT INTO tutorial.xyz values(8,'2022-07-25');
  ```
    * Query records
  ```
  SELECT * FROM tutorial.xyz;
  ```
* Clean up
  ```
  docker-compose down`
  ```

### Explore Metrics in Lightstep

See the [Clickhouse Telemetry Docs][clickhouse-docs-telemetry] for comprehensive documentation on metrics emitted and the [dashboard documentation][ls-docs-dashboards] for more details.

## Configure clickhouse

Clickhouse accepts trace context over a native protocol that is used for communication between ClickHouse servers or between the client and server. 

ClickHouse creates `trace spans` for each query and some of the query execution stages, such as query planning or distributed queries so the tracing information is exported to Prometheus.

For manual testing, trace context headers conforming to the Trace Context recommendation can be supplied to `clickhouse-client` using `--opentelemetry-traceparent` and `--opentelemetry-tracestate` flags.

## Configure the Collector

Below is a snippet showing how to configure the Prometheus Receiver to scrape the Prometheus endpoint exposed by the Clickhouse Server.

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'clickhouse'
          scrape_interval: 3s
          metrics_path: '/metrics'
          scheme: 'http'
          tls_config:
            insecure_skip_verify: true
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['clickhouse:8001']
```
