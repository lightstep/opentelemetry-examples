# Ingest Flink metrics using the OpenTelemetry Collector

## Overview

This example is inspired by https://github.com/mbode/flink-prometheus-example .

In order to expose Prometheus endpoint, you have to modify flink configuration and also add some Jar libraries. Checkout provided Dockerfile.

## Prerequisites

* Docker
* Docker Compose
* A Cloud Observability [access token][ls-docs-access-token]

## How to run the example

* Export your Cloud Observability access token
  ```
  export LS_ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
  ```
* Run the docker compose example
  ```
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

* Explore Metrics in Cloud Observability

* Stop the cluster
  ```
  docker-compose down`
  ```

## Configure the Collector

Below is a snippet showing how to configure the Prometheus Receiver to scrape the Prometheus endpoint exposed by the Flink.

```yaml
receivers:
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'flink'
          scrape_interval: 1s
          params:
            format: [ 'prometheus' ]
          scheme: 'http'
          tls_config:
            insecure_skip_verify: true
          static_configs:
            - targets: [ 'job-cluster:9249', 'taskmanager1:9249', 'taskmanager2:9249' ]

```
